ðŸ§  Python Quiz App â€“ Day 3 Project

This is a simple terminal-based multiple choice quiz app built in Python as part of my Four Weeks Python Challenge.

The app asks the user a series of questions, provides multiple answer options (A, B, C, D), gives instant feedback on each guess, and shows a final score at the end.


ðŸ“Œ Features

- 3+ multiple-choice questions
- Instant feedback (correct or wrong)
- Case-insensitive answer checking
- Final score summary at the end
- Input cleanup (trims spaces, handles lowercase/uppercase)

ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed
2. Open your terminal or command prompt
3. Navigate to the project folder

```bash
cd your_project_folder
